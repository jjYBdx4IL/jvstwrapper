Get the LMMS app image from: https://lmms.io/download/#linux and start it within this
directory. You should see "JayDLay 1.0" plugin when opening the LADSPA plugin list in
that application.

Beware! Java does not support foreign UIs within the same process. It may work on Linux for some time, but
it can produce random crashes. Check if your DAW supports loading plugins into their own processes if the
corresponding Java LADSPA plugin comes with its own GUI.
