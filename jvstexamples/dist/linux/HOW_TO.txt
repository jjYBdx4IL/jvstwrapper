Download the latest .zip file for _LINUX_ from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92192
and extract it to this directory. 

NOTE: You may need to rename the directory that is created from "jVSTwRapper_vXX" to "jVSTwRapper"
      Also, you may need to rename (i.e. remove the version part of) jvstwrapper-XXX.so to jvstwrapper.so
	  You can ignore all other files and directories from the extracted .zip file. Only those listed 
	  below are used (the rest is downloaded from the jvstwrapper maven repository).

For any details, please check vstplugin_linux.xml	  
	  
The expected directory layout is as follows:

.
|   HOW_TO.txt
|   JayDLay.ini

\---jVSTwRapper
        jvstwrapper.so          <--- YOU MAY NEED TO RENAME THIS FILE FROM jvstwrapper-XXX.so TO jvstwrapper.so
