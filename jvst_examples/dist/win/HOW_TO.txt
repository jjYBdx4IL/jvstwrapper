Download the latest .zip file for _WINDOWS_ from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92192
and extract it to this directory. 

NOTE: You may need to rename the directory that is created from "jVSTwRapper_vXX" to "jVSTwRapper"
      Also, you may need to rename (i.e. remove the version part of) jVSTwRapper-XXX.dll to jVSTwRapper.dll
      You can ignore all other files and directories from the extracted .zip file. Only those listed 
	  below are used (the rest is downloaded from the jvstwrapper maven repository).

For any details, please check vstplugin_win.xml
	  
The expected directory layout is as follows:
