Download the latest .zip file for _MAC OSX_ from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92192
and extract it to this directory. 

NOTE: You may need to rename the directory that is created from "jVSTwRapper_vXX" to "jVSTwRapper"
      You can ignore all other files and directories from the extracted .zip file. Only those listed 
	  below are used (the rest is downloaded from the jvstwrapper maven repository).
	  
For any details, please check vstplugin_osx.xml
